# Other Programs

This section contains pages about other programs that I find useful when working with reMarkable tablets.

## Calibre

[Calibre](calibre.md) is an ebook library manager. It does a LOT of useful things when it comes to ebooks. (See the page for more information.)

## goMarkableStream

[goMarkableStream](goMarkableStream.md) is a program which runs on the reMarkable tablet, and streams the contents of the display to a web browser on your computer. I've used it a few times to "share" the tablet's display in work meetings, by sharing the browser window where I was streaming the tablet.

## RCU

[RCU](rcu.md) (reMarkable Connection Utility) is "All-in-one management software for reMarkable e-paper tablets". It does a LOT of useful things when it comes to reMarkable tablets. (See the page for more information.)
