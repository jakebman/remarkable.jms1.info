# Move scripts to Github

I've created a [Github repo](https://github.com/kg4zow/rm2-scripts) to host the scripts and track their changes over time. Some of the scripts are already there, others are being added as I have time.

&#x21D2; [`https://github.com/kg4zow/rm2-scripts`](https://github.com/kg4zow/rm2-scripts)

### TODO

Create dirctories in the Github repo for each already-existing script on this site.

* convert each scripts page on this site, to a `README.md` file in each script's directory

* for template scripts, write/test individual `generate` scripts to make sure samples and thumbnails look right in the Github web interface

* update pages in this book to point to Github for each script, so I don't have to keep maintaining two sets of documentation.
