# Move scripts to Github

I've created a [Github repo](https://github.com/kg4zow/rm2-scripts) to host the scripts and track their changes over time. Some of the scripts are already there, others are being added as I have time.

&#x21D2; [`https://github.com/kg4zow/rm2-scripts`](https://github.com/kg4zow/rm2-scripts)

### TODO

Finish creating dirctories in the repo for each already-existing script

* convert this book's page text to a `README.md` file in each script's directory

* for template scripts, write/test individual `generate` scripts to make sure samples and thumbnails look right in the Github web interface

Update pages in this book to point to Github for each script, so I don't have to keep maintaining two copies of each script and two sets of documentation.

Move this page from "Future" to "Information" in the ToC (and change its title) once everything is migrated.
