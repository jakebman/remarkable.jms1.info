# RCU - reMarkable Connection Utility

[reMarkable Connection Utility](http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/), or RCU, is a third-party program to manage reMarkable tablets *without* using the reMarkable cloud service.

I'm not going to try and list *everything* it does, but the features that I use the most are ...

* Uploading and managing custom templates. This *can* be done by hand, however RCU makes it a lot easier.

* Moving notebooks, EPUB, and PDF files beween folders. Again, this *can* be done by hand, however RCU makes it easier.

* Virtual Printer. When the computer "prints" to it, the print job is saved as a PDF on the tablet.

* Screenshots. RCU is able to read the contents of the display and save it as a `.png` image file.

RCU isn't free, but it isn't expensive - I paid all of $12 for it.

Customers are able to download and run the program on as many machines as they like. They are also able to download the source code, access the `git` repository, and participate in a private "developer" mailing list. They're also entitled to free updates for a year - and to be honest, as long as the price stays the same, I'm fine with paying what amounts to a $12/yr subscription.

So far I've been very happy with it. If you have any interest in being able to do more with your reMarkable tablet than what the built-in software supports, or if you're using a tablet which doesn't sync with the reMarkable cloud, I *highly* recommend it.
