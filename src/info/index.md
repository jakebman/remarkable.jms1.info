# Information



## Other sources of info

- [`remarkable.com`](https://remarkable.com/) - official home page

- [reMarkableWiki](https://remarkablewiki.com/) - "wiki" site full of links and info about the reMarkable tablets

- [awesome-reMarkable](https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable) - list of "hacks" (which seems to be the term people use for making the tablet do anything other than run the built-in software). I found almost everything in the [hacks](../hacks/index.md) section from this page.

## Things to investigate

- [ReCalendar](https://recalendar.me/) - browser-base calendar generator ... generates a PDF containing "day planner" pages ... all work happens in the browser, nothing is uploaded anywhere

    I've seen the word "template" thrown around, not sur if this means the PDF is copied when creating a new (note? file? page?) or if it's used as a "background" and the user's content exist in a layer "above" that, or ... ?
