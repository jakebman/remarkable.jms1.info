# Introduction

As I write this (2023-06-25), I have *ordered* a [reMarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/) tablet, but have not received it yet. I plan on using this site as a way to record the information I learn about it, and the things I do to customize it.

I'm doing this for two reasons:

* So that I will have a reference to look back on in the future, in case I need it.

    I find that the act of writing documentation helps me to organize the details in my head.

* So that others who may find this information useful will have access to it as well.

There isn't really much to see yet, I plan to add information over time after the tablet shows up and I start playing/working with it.




## Created with `mdbook`

This "book" is being created using a program called [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), which allows me to write the content using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and have it converted to an HTML format that *I think* looks nice, especially with a few minor customizations.

And rather than making the same customizations every time I start a new "book" (I have several, both at work and for non-work), I created a template containing a newly created book with my customizations already in place.

## Keybase

I make use of [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) on a *very* regular basis.

* This site's "source code" is being tracked in a [Keybase git](https://book.keybase.io/git) repo.

* The site is being served using [Keybase Sites](https://book.keybase.io/sites).

## Feedback

I would appreciate any feedback you may have to offer about this book.

### Exception

The `/theme/index-template.hbs` file in the git repo, whose contents make up part of every generated HTML page, was copied from `/src/theme/index.hbs` in [the mdbook source](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/src/theme/index.hbs) and then modified. As such, that file is technically covered by the Mozilla Public License 2.0, [as noted in their repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/LICENSE).
