# Simple Cover Page


The `rm2-template-cover` shell script uses [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)'s `magick` command to create a simple `.png` template which can be used as a "cover page" for notebooks in a reMarkable tablet. It looks like this ...

* [`cover-simple-rm2.png`](cover-simple-rm2.png)

    ![cover-simple-rm2-sm.png](cover-simple-rm2-sm.png)

* [`cover-simple-rmpp.png`](cover-simple-rmpp.png)

    ![cover-simple-rmpp-sm.png](cover-simple-rmpp-sm.png)

*Hey, I said it was simple ...* &#x1F601;

The script's default settings will generate the rM2 template shown above. You can run it with options to generate an rMPP template instead, change the background colour, and change the height, width, and vertical position of the box. (Of course, you can also *edit the script* and make it do whatever you like.)
