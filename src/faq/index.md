# Frequently Asked Questions

I read [r/RemarkableTablet](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/) on Reddit, and sometimes I answer peoples' questions. I've noticed a few questions that people seem to ask, over and over again, and I've gotta be honest, explaining the same things over and over again gets really old.

If you're also reading there and you have a question, do yourself a favour and read through the existing questions and comments. There's a good chance that somebody has already asked and/or answered the same question.

The pages in this section will provide the answers that I normally provide when these questions come up.
